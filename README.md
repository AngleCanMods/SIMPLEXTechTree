A rework of the stock tech tree suitable for lightly modded saves.  All nodes utilised with Kerbalism and ReStockPlus! In 1.25 Engine Nerf has been removed.  SIMPLEX Propulsion is to be updated in the near future to support this.  Now including a fresh avionics experiment for the start of the TechTree!
